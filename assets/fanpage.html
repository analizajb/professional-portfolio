         You didn't have to be there during their peak popularity to enjoy and experience the sheer wonder of Queen. The performance Freddie Mercury showed was like no other artists at the time.
         With a mix of hard rock and a theatrical element to their songs, Queen distinguished themselves from other bands, not only during their time but even today.
         What made me fall in love with this band was Freddie Mercury's insane vocals and weirdly enough, his teeth! Mercury had extra 
         teeth, known as <a href="https://www.toothologydental.com/freddie-mercury-teeth/">mesiodens</a>, which caused his teeth to overjet due to the crowding. Growing up I also dealt with an overjet due to crowding which understandably
         made me insecure and not want to smile. Seeing the way Mercury embraced and celebrated his looks is what drew more of my attention 
         to this epic group. Not only are they known for their song writing and fun production, even their performances
          set them apart from others. They are one of those bands that cannot be compared to.
